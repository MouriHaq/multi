                We love houseplants for the way they can change the mood of a room. Succulents and cacti can create a desert-inspired feel,
                 while trendy, multicolored plants add contemporary charm. But tropicals—many of our most beloved houseplants—might be 
                 the most transformative of all. These are some of the best tropical houseplants for creating lush, jungle-like 
                 vibes in your space.

            <h2>Tropical Plants</h2>
            <p>
                Tropical plants can bring color and flair to your home even if you live in a colder climate. 
                While some tropical houseplants are best known for their eye-popping flowers, others are loved 
                for their large, unusually patterned, or variegated leaves. 
                Tropical plants are not always as difficult to grow as they appear while others are a bit fussy 
                until they are happy with their level of humidity, light, and moisture. Most tropical plants need 
                to grow with an indoor humidity level between 50 to 60 percent. But if you don't have that type of
                humidity in your home, you can always place a tropical plant in your bathroom, laundry room, 
                or kitchen where there's usually a natural level of humidity. Read on to learn about the following 
                popular tropical plants to grow indoors.

            <h3>Succulents</h3>
            <p>
                Succulents are sometimes mistakenly thought of as just desert plants, but their reach goes far beyond that. 
                You can find succulents across multiple plant families with dozens of varieties growing all over the world — 
                from houseleeks high in the Pyrenees mountains to ice plant, a South African native you can find sprawling 
                alongside California's coastal highways.
