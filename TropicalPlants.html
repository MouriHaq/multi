            Tropical plants can bring color and flair to your home even if you live in a colder climate. 
            While some tropical houseplants are best known for their eye-popping flowers, others are loved 
            for their large, unusually patterned, or variegated leaves. 
            Tropical plants are not always as difficult to grow as they appear while others are a bit fussy 
            until they are happy with their level of humidity, light, and moisture. Most tropical plants need 
            to grow with an indoor humidity level between 50 to 60 percent. But if you don't have that type of
            humidity in your home, you can always place a tropical plant in your bathroom, laundry room, 
            or kitchen where there's usually a natural level of humidity. Read on to learn about the following 
            popular tropical plants to grow indoors.

                Orchids are the most varied of all plant groupsâ€”they come from all over the world from deserts to woodlands to tropical forests, but the orchids most people love are from tropical and subtropical climates. A flowering orchid is the quintessential tropical plant with its color varieties of white, yellow, pink, purple, red, orange, and variegated. Avoid dry air, direct heat or drafts, and direct sunlight. Instead, provide a warm humid environment. In general, once per week; allow to dry between waterings; do not overwater

                Dieffenbachia is ubiquitous as a houseplant, so it is easy to forget it is also a true tropical foliage plant. To grow this popular plant with its large green and white leaves, use a fast-draining potting mix and fertilize with a 20-20-20 mix. Locate it in a warm (over 60 degrees Fahrenheit) and draft-free location. Water twice a week, and reduce water in the winter.
