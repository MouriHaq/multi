            Succulents naturally grow in warm and dry climates with a lot of sun. To successfully grow a succulent in your house, when you don't live in a warm and dry climate, you'll need to mimic its natural habitat the best you can.
            One way to do this is to make sure your succulent doesn't get watered very often. It thrives when you don't water it for weeks at a time. Watering succulents too often will cause the plant to be overwatered and this will kill it. Too much water can cause root rot and other issues.
